# Twitter Userstyle

Bring the aesthetic of Twitter for iOS to the [newly updated Twitter.com](https://twitter.com/twitter/status/422840296175443968) with this custom userstyle.

### What changes

* Overrides nearly all of the new accent color treatment across the interface.
* Styles the topbar like that of iOS.
* Changes the stats design to look closer to iOS.
* Fixes the inconsistent border colors by using the same color across the board.
* Makes the topbar full-width instead of being slightly wider than the content.
* Outright hides the Who to Follow widget those avatars are quite large and the buttons' text is misaligned.

### Why

More than anything else, this is an hour-long experiment that I decided to open
source. I enjoy using Twitter's native apps and believe the same design can work
on all platforms.

Beyond that, I think (and hope) Twitter can grow to longer support user themes
or customizations (beyond profile avatars and headers) without sacrificing the 
overall experience or utility. So far, I'm enjoying it.
